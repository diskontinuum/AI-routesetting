"""
The moonboard is a fixed-size grid
 indexed by capitalized roman letters {A,...,K} horizontally and
 indexed by integers {1,...,18} vertically.
 Each grid point has a fixed hold attached to it.
 A given setup specifiex the hold type and hold orientation
 on every grid point.
 For every official setup there is a collection of boulder problems, which
 are specified simply as set of coordinates, designating the holds
  that may be used when climbing the board.

 Here we consider the 2016 moonboard setup, which has the largest
 collection of problems (TODO: verify).
